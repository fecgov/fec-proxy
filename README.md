# fec-proxy

Reverse proxy app to combine multiple applications and redirect rules for fec.gov.

## Configuration

Set the `PROXIES` environment variable to a JSON object mapping proxy routes to URLs. As an example, you can do this manually with a command similar to this:

    cf set-env fec-proxy PROXIES='{"/": "https://app1.app.cloud.gov", "/app2": "https://app1.app.cloud.gov"}'

*Note that this is currently set and configured in the manifest files for deployment.*

## Deployment

The proxy follows [other projects](https://github.com/fecgov/openFEC#creating-a-release) for the release and hotfix processes. The changes will automatically deploy when PR's are merged, or the release is cut and deployed.

However, it is best to deploy the proxy app at night because it may temporarily effect our routes and wagtail work during deploy. For this reason, builds require manual approval in CircleCI to run.

## Manual deployment

Before you start, make sure you have version 7 of the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) installed.

When you're ready to deploy any changes, make sure you are on the `master` branch and have done a `git pull` so that all changes are pulled down.  Now run the following commands, where `<space>` is the desired space you'd like to deploy to (`dev`, `stage`, or `prod`):

```sh
    cf target -s <space>
    cf push --strategy rolling proxy -f manifest_<space>.yml
```

When the deployment is done, be sure to test the site to make sure everything is still functioning.

### Testing changes before deploying to Production

If you'd like to test any changes before they are fully merged and made a part of the code, you should feel free to do so but only in the `dev` and `staging` spaces.  To do this, just make sure you are on the branch you are currently working in and follow the deployment instructions above.

Just be sure to deploy the `master` branch again once the code is merged in (or the changes are rejected/abandoned).
